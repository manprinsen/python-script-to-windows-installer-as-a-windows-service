```python 
IF YOU == "have headache trying to deploy your python script as a windows service?":
    print("please follow along!")
```
    

### Disclaimer
Steps below is tested on python 3.10 and windows server 2019

### Preperations
* Download and install Inno Setup
https://jrsoftware.org/download.php/is.exe
* Download and unzip NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager
https://nssm.cc/ci/nssm-2.24-101-g897c7ad.zip

### Step by step
* Create a folder at C:\inno-setup
* Copy the nssm.exe from the unzipped NSSM directory .\nssm-2.24-101-g897c7ad\win64\ to C:\inno-setup\
* Create a python script inside C:\inno-setup\ called program.py
* Copy and paste the code below the program.py
```python
import logging
import time

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s :: %(levelname)s :: %(message)s',
    filename="debug.log",
    filemode="w"
)

while True:
    logging.debug("loop is running")
    time.sleep(1)
```

#### We then need to install pyinstaller 
* Open Powershell or CMD and run ```pip install pyinstaller```
* Using the same prompt run ```cd C:\inno-setup\```
* Convert the python script to executable by using ```pyinstaller -w --add-data "nssm.exe;." .\program.py```
All your files and the executable are located at C:\inno-setup\dist\program\
* Copy the inno-setup.iss to C:\inno-setup\
* Double click on it to open it in the Inno Setup program

For future preferences; you can change the variables at the top of the script
```pascal
#define MyAppName "my-service"
#define MyAppVersion "1.0"
#define MyAppExeName "program.exe"
#define SourceLocation "C:\inno-setup\dist\program"
#define OutputLocation "C:\inno-setup\output"
```

* Edit the line ```AppId={{80B065A7-2B18-4547-A87E-EC1B544881C2}``` remove the ```{80B065A7-2B18-4547-A87E-EC1B544881C2}``` to is looks like this: ```AppId={``` (yes its correct). 
* Place your cursor at the end of the {
* At the top menu go to Tools then Generate GUID
* At the top menu go to Build then Compile
A output folder should now be created together with the setup file at C:\inno-setup\output\mysetup.exe
* Double click on it to install the program and service.

Your service should now be located at C:\Program Files (x86)\my-service\
Open the debug.log file to verify that the service is actually running.

Also verify the the service exist in the windows services. Go to Run and type services.msc
You should have a windows service called ```my-service```

Over and out

```python
ELSE:
    return False
```
